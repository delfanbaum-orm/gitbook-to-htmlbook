# gitbook-to-htmlbook
Python script that takes a gitbook and turns it into an Atlas htmlbook

Some things more or less complete:
- toc processing
- part processing
- figure processing/moving
- chapter processing (with some elements still needing work)

Some things needing doing:
- appendix processing (should be able to re-use part processing)
- bibliography/references processing (note to use author-date format)
